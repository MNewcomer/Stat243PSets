### Problem 5


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

There are inline equations such as $y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + e_i$.
 
And displayed formulas:
 
$$\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$$
